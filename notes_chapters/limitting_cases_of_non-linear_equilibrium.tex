\subsubsection*{case 1: $A_0^2 \gg E_{\mathrm{lin-thr}}$}

\textbf{look for approximate daughter mode amplitudes.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection*{case 2: $A_0^2 -  E_{\mathrm{lin-thr}} \ll  E_{\mathrm{lin-thr}}$}

\textbf{look for approximate daughter mode amplitudes.}
